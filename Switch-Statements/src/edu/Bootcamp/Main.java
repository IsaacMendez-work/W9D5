/*
A switch is a way to implement conditional logic by testing a single value against multiple potential-matches.
For example:
      switch (value-to-test) {
          case matching-value-1:
              statements-to-do
              break;
          case matching-value-2:
              other-statements
              break;
          case matching-value-N:
              more-statements
              break;
          default:
              statements
      }
NOTE: default is optional.
NOTE: break is optional, but recommended if you don't want to run every following case until the end of the switch statement.

Only integer and char primitive data types can be used with a switch.
